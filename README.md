# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

##  My name is Anthony Horner, I'm a software engineer located in South Florida with over 5 years of experience. 

I found my passion for coding in my early years of high school, where I had the opportunity to study intro to robotics where I studied Python and programming with Arduino's. Immediately after joining this class, I knew my career path. This led me to study Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University in which I graduated in 2020. 

During my professional experience, I have worked mostly in web development with a vast spread of technologies ranging from the IOT industry to E-commerce stores.
